    <a title="Lately I&#39;ve been thinking about why early childhood experience is so pivotal in forming your character even though people remember very little of it.

Infants are completely helpless against their environment and it makes sense that&#39;s going to create a crushing insecurity where their only defense is people pleasing. Without that sort of behavior you&#39;d likely see infant mortality much higher and so evolution has an incentive to dial people pleasing up to a ridiculous degree. Psychologically speaking I don&#39;t think infancy is too dissimilar to having a gun pulled on you. You&#39;re just a few pounds of force away from death in that situation. It&#39;s completely reasonable to do or say anything necessary.

I&#39;m having trouble articulating this. It seems like this sort of primordial insecurity and need to be taken care of is at the root of social behavior. It seems to crush the individual in the name of the group. That sort of need seems to stick around until you&#39;re in your late 20&#39;s. I think it&#39;s what normies mean when they say &#34;settle down&#34;. What they mean is that their intense need for attention and validation has dropped to a manageable, stable level.

That much of social interaction as a need seems inborn. Another part seems to stem from convenience. Two 4/5 fighters can easily overpower a single 5/5 fighter. Or to put it another way I&#39;d have a lot more money and free time if I had a roommate who I got along with because of simple economies of scale.

What seems to happen for a lot of loners like myself is some sort of failure on part of the parents to respond to the child&#39;s natural people pleasing behavior. The child learns people pleasing as a strategy doesn&#39;t work and tries their hardest to do everything themselves. It seems to set you up for all sorts of pitfalls in school. You already don&#39;t have support at home. More importantly you&#39;ve disposed of people pleasing as a strategy while all the other children are still in that mode, hard. It seems to be why if you ever complain about a lack of relationships to normals they always get pissed and make it your fault. They don&#39;t understand you literally don&#39;t have the same machinery to work with. They&#39;re very insecure about it. You&#39;ll often see normals chestpound about
