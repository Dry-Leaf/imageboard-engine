I don&#39;t think about it much, but that&#39;s more or less my own experience in life. There is no drive or desire to socialize beyond getting people to leave me be. I rarely try and get help unless it&#39;s completely necessary. It just isn&#39;t my instinct to seek it out because it hasn&#39;t done me much good in the past.
So I&#39;d say your thoughts are probably accurate to some degree." href="/ot/1.html#no4">

I don&#39;t want to keep flooding the /navi/ thread, so I&#39;ll post updates here from now on. Crushed some bugs, and added some features, including rate limiting(ended up only needing the stdlib for that).

I added a feature I&#39;m slightly unsure about since it&#39;s pretty unconventional. CSS allows you to define the maximum height and width an image can occupy based on the viewport. I decided to use this to limit how large a thumbnail can expand. I think this improves the user experience, since you&#39;ll never scroll to look at an image piece by piece, or open it in a new tab.

I&#39;m a little worried it&#39;ll mislead people into thinking images are lower res than they really are . The file info does include the real image dimensions though. Pic is a comparison of my behavior compared to tc&#39;s. " href="/mu/1.html#no2">

    <a title="Lately I&#39;ve been thinking about why early childhood experience is so pivotal in forming your character even though people remember very little of it.

Infants are completely helpless against their environment and it makes sense that&#39;s going to create a crushing insecurity where their only defense is people pleasing. Without that sort of behavior you&#39;d likely see infant mortality much higher and so evolution has an incentive to dial people pleasing up to a ridiculous degree. Psychologically speaking I don&#39;t think infancy is too dissimilar to having a gun pulled on you. You&#39;re just a few pounds of force away from death in that situation. It&#39;s completely reasonable to do or say anything necessary.

I&#39;m having trouble articulating this. It seems like this sort of primordial insecurity and need to be taken care of is at the root of social behavior. It seems to crush the individual in the name of the group. That sort of need seems to stick around until you&#39;re in your late 20&#39;s. I think it&#39;s what normies mean when they say &#34;settle down&#34;. What they mean is that their intense need for attention and validation has dropped to a manageable, stable level.

That much of social interaction as a need seems inborn. Another part seems to stem from convenience. Two 4/5 fighters can easily overpower a single 5/5 fighter. Or to put it another way I&#39;d have a lot more money and free time if I had a roommate who I got along with because of simple economies of scale.
